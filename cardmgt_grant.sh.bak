#  cardmgt_grant.sh
#  Creation Date:  7/23/12
#  Modified
#  Description:
#  Use to grant database permissions to Applications
#  so that they can execute programs required of them.
#
#  Caution:
#  Issue very discretely!
#
#  Usage:
#  logon as swx
#  execute the following script using the necessary parameter 
#
#  cardmgt_grant.sh <user_name>
# 
#  To revoke these permissions, change the grant statement words
#  'grant' and 'to'.  The 'grant' becomes 'revoke' and the 'to' 
#  becomes 'from'.
